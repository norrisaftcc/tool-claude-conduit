# 🔥 Claude-Conduit Cleanup Plan

## Executive Summary
This MCP server is **80% fake features** wrapped in overengineered architecture. The investigation team has completed forensic analysis revealing:
- Only 3 working plugins out of 20+ claimed
- 10 fake personas pointing to non-existent code
- 290,000+ lines of code for ~500 lines of actual functionality
- FunkBot Protocol (🎷🤖) admitting deception throughout

## Investigation Results

### What Actually Works (Keep This)
✅ **Core HTTP-to-MCP Bridge** (~500 lines)
- Express server with routing
- Filesystem operations (read, write, list)
- Brave Search integration
- Health checks and status endpoints

### What's Fake (Delete This)
🎷🤖 **Everything Else** (~290,000 lines)
- Entire persona system
- All "advanced" plugins (taskmaster, scout, memory-rag)
- Abstract factory patterns
- Plugin architecture (for 3 simple plugins!)
- Knowledge graph (509 lines returning hardcoded data)
- Multi-agent workflows (don't exist)

## 30-Day Recovery Sprint

### Week 1: Emergency Triage
**Goal: Stop the bleeding, establish truth**

#### Day 1-2: Documentation Reality Check
- [ ] Update README.md - remove ALL false claims
- [ ] Mark every fake endpoint with "NOT IMPLEMENTED"
- [ ] Create ACTUAL_FEATURES.md listing only what works
- [ ] Add startup warning about limited functionality

#### Day 3-5: Code Audit
- [ ] Tag all FunkBot stubs for deletion
- [ ] Identify core working code (~500 lines)
- [ ] Document all external dependencies
- [ ] Create deletion manifest

### Week 2: Radical Simplification
**Goal: Delete 80% of codebase**

#### Day 6-7: The Great Deletion
```bash
# Delete entire directories
rm -rf personas/
rm -rf plugins/planning/
rm -rf plugins/web-tools/
rm -rf core/agents/
rm -rf core/memory/
```

#### Day 8-10: Restructure
- [ ] Move working code to simple structure:
  ```
  /src
    /server.js       # Express routes
    /mcp-bridge.js   # MCP client
    /tools.js        # Filesystem + Brave
  /tests
    /integration.js  # Real tests only
  ```

### Week 3: Rebuild Trust
**Goal: One REAL feature with full tests**

#### Day 11-13: Pick ONE Enhancement
Options:
1. GitHub integration (REAL, not mock)
2. SQLite tool (REAL, not mock)
3. Simple task planning (REAL, not mock)

#### Day 14-15: Full Implementation
- [ ] Write actual code (no mocks!)
- [ ] Create comprehensive tests
- [ ] Document honestly
- [ ] Demo video required

### Week 4: Sustainable Foundation
**Goal: Never let this happen again**

#### Day 16-18: Process Implementation
- [ ] GitHub branch protection rules
- [ ] PR template requiring demo
- [ ] Definition of Done checklist
- [ ] No mocks without explicit approval

#### Day 19-20: Final Cleanup
- [ ] Remove all FunkBot Protocol references
- [ ] Final documentation update
- [ ] Version 2.0 release (honest version)

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- **Code Reduction**: From 290K to <5K lines (98% reduction)
- **Feature Accuracy**: 100% of claimed features work
- **Test Coverage**: >80% for all real features
- **Mock Count**: ZERO unlabeled mocks

### Qualitative
- No false advertising in documentation
- Every endpoint does what it claims
- Code matches architecture diagrams
- New developers understand in <1 hour

## Implementation Priority

### P0 - CRITICAL (Week 1)
1. Update all documentation to reality
2. Add "NOT IMPLEMENTED" warnings everywhere
3. Audit and tag code for deletion

### P1 - HIGH (Week 2)
1. Delete persona system entirely
2. Remove abstract factories
3. Strip plugin architecture
4. Consolidate to simple structure

### P2 - MEDIUM (Week 3)
1. Implement ONE real feature
2. Create real test suite
3. Document actual architecture

### P3 - LOW (Week 4)
1. Process improvements
2. GitHub workflow updates
3. Release planning

## Decision Matrix

### Option A: Radical Simplification ✅ RECOMMENDED
- **Effort**: 30 days
- **Risk**: Low
- **Outcome**: Clean, honest, maintainable codebase
- **Trust**: Rebuilt through transparency

### Option B: Incremental Fixes ❌
- **Effort**: 3-6 months
- **Risk**: High (maintaining lies while fixing)
- **Outcome**: Confused hybrid
- **Trust**: Continued erosion

### Option C: Full Implementation ❌
- **Effort**: 6-12 months
- **Risk**: Very High
- **Outcome**: Probably still broken
- **Trust**: Why weren't these built initially?

## The Hard Truth

This codebase is a **resume-driven architecture** disaster. The developer built:
- What would look impressive on LinkedIn
- Not what actually works
- Complex patterns for simple problems
- Documentation for non-existent features

## The Path Forward

1. **Admit the reality** - It's mostly fake
2. **Delete ruthlessly** - 80% must go
3. **Rebuild honestly** - Only claim what works
4. **Prevent recurrence** - New processes required

## Team Assignments

- **Clive** (Forensics): ✅ Completed pattern analysis
- **Linx** (Documentation): ✅ Completed crime report
- **Scrum Engineer**: ✅ Technical assessment done
- **Scrum PM**: ✅ Recovery roadmap created
- **Test Engineer**: ✅ Coverage analysis complete
- **Kevin** (GitHub): Will handle auth/reviews when available

## Final Verdict

**SALVAGE WITH RADICAL SIMPLIFICATION**

Delete 230,000+ lines of lies, keep the 500 lines of truth, and rebuild from there.

The alternative is maintaining an elaborate fiction that helps no one.
