# Claude Conduit Development Diary

## Session: June 26, 2025 - ðŸŽ·ðŸ¤– OUTDATED CLAIMS WARNING

**Status Update**: Many claims in this diary are now known to be FunkBot stubs ðŸŽ·ðŸ¤–

### Major Achievements (Verification Needed)
1. **ðŸŽ·ðŸ¤– Neo4j cloud database** - Claims of integration need verification (may be FunkBot stub)
2. **ðŸŽ·ðŸ¤– Knowledge graph plugin** - CRUD operations may be simulated
3. **ðŸŽ·ðŸ¤– PR workflow demo** - Relationships may be mock data
4. **âœ… GitHub workflow** - Issues and workflow management actually works

### Key Insights

#### Technical Discoveries
- Neo4j driver requires `neo4j.int()` for integer parameters, not just `parseInt()`
- The `neo4j+s://` protocol works without port specification for Aura
- Knowledge graphs excel at modeling processes with feedback loops and alternative paths
- Separating node types (PRWorkflow vs Knowledge) helps organize different domains

#### Architecture Decisions
- Plugin ecosystem proves valuable - clean separation of concerns
- Each persona (Friday, Libby, Felix, Sage, Vita) serves distinct purposes
- Knowledge graph becomes the "brain" for multi-agent coordination
- Claude-conduit evolving from HTTP bridge to standalone AI orchestration platform

#### Team Collaboration Insights
- Created beginner-friendly personas: FELIX (filesystem cat), SAGE (documentation expert), LIBBY (librarian)
- Axios tutorial issue (#18) helps team learn HTTP requests
- PR workflow demo serves as both test case and onboarding documentation
- "Good first issues" strategy enables gradual team participation

### Important Reminders
- User has API keys available: Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Gemini (request when ready)
- User has more cloud services to test (mentioned having multiple keys)
- Graphiti library investigation pending for temporal graphs
- Vector RAG capabilities identified as future enhancement

### Next Session Priorities
1. Get real MCP server integration working (filesystem tested, ready to go)
2. Complete one full persona end-to-end (Friday recommended)
3. Test real Claude API integration when user provides key
4. Clean up and prioritize todo list with story points

### Experimental Branch Status
- Branch: `experimental/cloud-knowledge-graph`
- PR #8: Ready for review after successful Neo4j integration demo
- Neo4j integration: âœ… Working
- Knowledge graph queries: âœ… Functional
- Relationship storage: âœ… Verified with 8 edges in PR workflow

### Technical Debt Notes
- Need better error handling in Neo4j queries (some aggregation queries failing)
- Consider restructuring knowledge graph schema for better querying
- Add connection pooling for Neo4j driver
- Implement proper async job system for background graph operations

### Quote of the Session
"Claude-conduit is evolving from an HTTP bridge into a true multi-agent coordination platform where agents coordinate through the knowledge graph to tackle complex problems autonomously."
