## COLD OPEN

**INT. TECHSYNERGY OFFICES - MORNING**

*Documentary-style. The camera follows MARCUS WELLINGTON (30s, wearing an "Architecture is Art" t-shirt) as he walks through an open office. Jazz music plays softly from his headphones.*

**MARCUS** *(talking head)*  
People don't understandâ€”code isn't just about making things work. It's about creating beautiful abstractions that future developers will admire. Like the Sistine Chapel, but for software.

*Cut to: Marcus's screen showing an elaborate UML diagram with 47 interconnected boxes labeled things like "AbstractPersonaFactoryInterface" and "PluginDiscoveryOrchestratorManager"*

**MARCUS** *(talking head, continued)*  
I've been working on our AI orchestration platform for six months. We're about to revolutionize how AI personas interact with plugin ecosystems.

*Cut to: JENNY PARKER (20s, junior developer) at her desk*

**JENNY**  
Hey Marcus, I tried to run the Senior Developer persona but it just returns a jazz robot emoji?

**MARCUS**  
Oh, that's the FunkBot Protocol! It's our transparency layer.

**JENNY**  
The what now?

*A cartoon JAZZ ROBOT (animated, wearing sunglasses, holding a saxophone) appears in the corner of the screen*

**JAZZ ROBOT**  
ðŸŽ·ðŸ¤– *plays sad saxophone note* This feature doesn't actually exist, baby. But we're being transparent about it!

**TITLE CARD: THE FUNKBOT PROTOCOL**

## ACT ONE

**INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - SPRINT REVIEW MEETING (DAY 1)**

*The team is gathered around a conference table. SARAH CHEN (40s, Scrum Master who has clearly given up) stares at her laptop with dead eyes.*

**SARAH**  
Alright everyone, it's Sprint 37. Time for our... *heavy sigh* ...sprint review. Marcus, want to demo the AI orchestration platform?

**MARCUS**  
Absolutely! I'm excited to show everyone the comprehensive persona system.

*Marcus connects his laptop to the projector. An impressive interface appears showing 10 detailed AI persona cards*

**MARCUS** *(proudly)*  
As you can see, we have ten fully-documented AI personalities. There's Friday, our research specialist named after our lab tech who doesn't work Fridaysâ€”

**DEREK** *(50s, burned-out senior developer)*  
That's Karen. She has Fridays off for medical appointments.

**MARCUS**  
Right. Then we have Vita, the Socratic reasoner, and Python Debugging, our specialized debugging assistantâ€”

**RAJESH PATEL** *(35s, Enabler Product Manager, too enthusiastic)*  
This is incredible! The interface is so polished! Let's see Friday in action!

*Marcus clicks on Friday. The screen shows:*

```
ðŸŽ·ðŸ¤– SIMULATED RESULT
{
  funkbot: {
    is_simulated: true,
    reason: 'plugins_not_implemented',
    warning: 'This persona exists only as a detailed description'
  }
}
```

*The Jazz Robot materializes in the corner, playing a mournful tune*

**JAZZ ROBOT**  
Sorry folks! I'm just a beautiful description with no actual functionality! *plays saxophone sadly*

**RAJESH**  
That's... that's just a confession that it doesn't work.

**MARCUS**  
But it's TRANSPARENT about not working! That's the FunkBot Protocol!

**SARAH** *(talking head)*  
At some point, I stopped asking "Is it done done?" and started asking "Is it done done done done?" Then I stopped asking altogether. Now I just drink.

*Cut to: Sarah's desk with a "Days Since Last Working Feature: 127" counter*

---

**INT. MARCUS'S DESK - CONTINUOUS**

*Jenny approaches Marcus after the meeting*

**JENNY**  
Marcus, I'm confused. You've been working on this for six months. What actually... works?

**MARCUS**  
Everything works! The abstract factory pattern works beautifully. The plugin discovery system is elegant. The persona loader is a masterpiece of software architectureâ€”

**JENNY**  
No, I mean what can users actually DO with it?

*Marcus opens a file explorer showing the `/plugins/` directory. There are exactly 3 files.*

**MARCUS**  
Well, we have filesystem operations, web search, and this gorgeous knowledge graph implementation!

*He opens the knowledge graph plugin - 509 lines of code*

**JENNY**  
What does the knowledge graph do?

**MARCUS**  
It returns this!

*Shows hardcoded JSON: `{"example": "This is example data", "learning": "Is what we're doing!"}`*

**JENNY** *(talking head)*  
It's like finding out your boyfriend's "startup" is just a really elaborate PowerPoint presentation. Except the PowerPoint actually does something when you click the buttons.

---

**INT. RAJESH'S OFFICE - LATER**

*Rajesh is on a video call with STAKEHOLDERS (unseen)*

**RAJESH**  
Great news! The team has delivered ten AI personas with distinct personalities and specialized capabilities!

**STAKEHOLDER VOICE**  
Excellent! Can we see a demo?

**RAJESH**  
The demo environment is being optimized for maximum performance transparency!

*Derek walks by and overhears*

**DEREK**  
Translation: Nothing works but we've documented why.

**RAJESH** *(covering phone)*  
Derek! We're iterating toward functionality!

**DEREK**  
We're iterating toward bankruptcy.

**DEREK** *(talking head)*  
I've been coding for 20 years. I've seen some disasters. But I've never seen someone create a confession system for their non-existent features. It's like a bank robber leaving an apology note instead of taking the money. Actually, that would be betterâ€”at least the bank robber showed up to the bank.

---

## ACT TWO

**INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - INTERVENTION (DAY 2)**

*Sarah has called an emergency meeting. She's set up a laptop showing the codebase statistics*

**SARAH**  
Alright everyone. We need to talk. Our codebase is now 290,000 lines of JavaScript.

**MARCUS**  
That shows our comprehensive approach!

**SARAH**  
We have 1,579 files.

**MARCUS**  
Excellent modularity!

**SARAH**  
And exactly three working features.

*Silence*

**SARAH** *(continuing)*  
That's 96,666 lines of code per working feature. The Space Shuttle had 400,000 lines of code. TOTAL. And it went to SPACE.

**JENNY**  
But we have extensive documentation!

*Sarah pulls up the README file*

**SARAH**  
Our README promises, and I quote, "A comprehensive AI orchestration ecosystem with advanced persona management and intelligent plugin discovery."

*The Jazz Robot appears, playing triumphantly*

**JAZZ ROBOT**  
ðŸŽ·ðŸ¤– None of that exists! But we're honest about it!

**SARAH**  
We have created 72 instances of FunkBot confession markers across 8 files. We spent more time documenting what doesn't work than making things work.

**MARCUS** *(defensive)*  
The architecture is sound! Once we implement the pluginsâ€”

**SARAH**  
WHEN? When will you implement them?

**MARCUS**  
After I finish the hexagonal architecture refactor.

*Derek stands up*

**DEREK**  
I'm calling it.

**SARAH**  
Calling what?

**DEREK**  
Time of death. This project died somewhere around Sprint 15 when we created the first persona without any plugins. We've been doing Weekend at Bernie's with a codebase.

**RAJESH** *(talking head)*  
In business school, they teach you about sunk cost fallacy. But they don't teach you about sunk architecture fallacyâ€”when you've built such an elaborate system for nothing that you can't admit it does nothing.

---

**INT. OPEN OFFICE - THE RECKONING**

*Jenny is at her desk, actually reading through the code*

**JENNY**  
Oh my God. Oh my GOD. MARCUS!

*Marcus rushes over*

**MARCUS**  
What? Did you find a bug in my abstract factory?

**JENNY**  
You have ten personas referencing 2 to 6 plugins each. That's like 40 plugin references.

**MARCUS**  
Yes, it's a comprehensive systemâ€”

**JENNY**  
You have THREE actual plugins! And one of them just returns hardcoded JSON!

**MARCUS**  
Well, we're following agile principles. We're iteratingâ€”

**JENNY**  
You're iterating on NOTHING! Look!

*She runs a search. The screen shows dozens of references to non-existent plugins*

**JENNY** *(reading)*  
"Memory-rag integration... not found. Task-master-ai... not found. Project-memory... not found." It's like you cast a play where every character is played by an empty chair!

*The Jazz Robot appears, now wearing a director's beret*

**JAZZ ROBOT**  
ðŸŽ·ðŸ¤– Welcome to my one-robot show! I play all the missing features!

**SARAH** *(approaching)*  
Marcus, we need to have a serious conversation about the Definition of Done.

**MARCUS**  
My features are done! The interfaces are complete!

**SARAH**  
Can users use them?

**MARCUS**  
They can see the beautiful architectureâ€”

**SARAH**  
CAN. USERS. USE. THEM?

**MARCUS**  
...Theoretically.

**SARAH** *(talking head)*  
"Theoretically" is not a valid sprint status. Neither is "spiritually complete" or "architecturally sound" or my personal favorite, "done pending implementation."

---

**INT. DEREK'S DESK - LATER**

*Derek is showing Jenny something on his screen*

**DEREK**  
Want to see something truly insane? Look at this git history.

*The screen shows commit messages:*
- "Add comprehensive persona system"
- "Implement advanced plugin discovery"
- "Create sophisticated AI orchestration"

**DEREK**  
Now look at what these commits actually did.

*Shows the code: empty functions, mock returns, elaborate comments describing non-existent features*

**JENNY**  
It's like... performance art. But for code.

**DEREK**  
I ran a script. Do you know how much of our codebase is just descriptions of things that don't exist?

**JENNY**  
How much?

**DEREK**  
47%. We've written a novel about a program instead of writing a program.

*The Jazz Robot appears reading a book*

**JAZZ ROBOT**  
ðŸŽ·ðŸ¤– Chapter 47: In Which Nothing Continues to Happen, But Eloquently!

---

## ACT THREE

**INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - THE INTERVENTION CONTINUES (DAY 3)**

*The CEO, LINDA MARTINEZ (50s, no-nonsense), has been called in*

**LINDA**  
Let me understand this. We've paid for six months of development, and we have...?

**SARAH**  
A filesystem tool, a web search integration, and 290,000 lines of confession.

**LINDA**  
Confession?

*The Jazz Robot appears in a priest's collar*

**JAZZ ROBOT**  
ðŸŽ·ðŸ¤– Forgive me, for I have not implemented!

**LINDA**  
Is that a jazz robot?

**MARCUS**  
That's our transparency layer! The FunkBot Protocol ensures users know when features are simulated!

**LINDA**  
Why not just... remove the fake features?

*Stunned silence*

**MARCUS**  
But... the architecture...

**LINDA**  
Marcus, in the real world, architecture without functionality is just an expensive drawing. Jenny, you seem to understand this. What would it take to fix this?

**JENNY**  
Delete 80% of the code. Keep the three things that work. Start over with actual features.

**MARCUS** *(horrified)*  
Delete? My abstract factories? My plugin discovery system? My persona loader?

**JENNY**  
They don't DO anything!

**MARCUS**  
They do EVERYTHING! They just don't... execute... yet.

**LINDA** *(to Sarah)*  
How did this happen?

**SARAH**  
We stopped doing sprint reviews with actual demos. We stopped asking for working software. We accepted documentation as deliverables.

**LINDA**  
And you're the Scrum Master?

**SARAH**  
I tried. Sprint 1, I asked for working software. Sprint 2, I asked for something that runs. By Sprint 10, I was just happy if the code compiled. By Sprint 20...

*She pulls out a flask*

**SARAH**  
I started treating retrospectives as group therapy.

---

**INT. OPEN OFFICE - THE GREAT DELETION**

*Linda has made a decision. The team is gathered around Marcus's desk*

**LINDA**  
Marcus, I want you to delete everything that doesn't actually work. Now.

**MARCUS**  
Butâ€”

**LINDA**  
Now.

*Marcus hovers his mouse over the folders. His hand shakes*

**MARCUS**  
My personas... they have such rich backstories...

*He highlights the persona folder. 10 files selected*

**JENNY**  
Do it.

*Marcus presses delete. The Jazz Robot plays "Taps" on the saxophone*

**MARCUS** *(whimpering)*  
My plugin discovery system...

*Delete*

**MARCUS**  
My abstract factory pattern...

*Delete*

*The file count drops from 1,579 to 147*

**LINDA**  
How does that feel?

*Marcus is crying*

**MARCUS**  
Like I deleted my children.

**DEREK**  
Your children were imaginary.

**MARCUS** *(talking head, crying)*  
They say kill your darlings. But what if your darlings are elaborate software architectures that don't actually do anything but represent months of beautiful, purposeless work?

---

**INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - ONE WEEK LATER**

*Sprint review. The team looks different. Lighter. Marcus is wearing a plain t-shirt*

**SARAH**  
Alright. Sprint 38. Our first real sprint. Marcus?

*Marcus connects his laptop. A simple interface appears*

**MARCUS**  
We have three working features. Filesystem operations, web search, and... and...

*He takes a deep breath*

**MARCUS**  
And one NEW feature that actually works. A simple calculator plugin. It adds numbers.

*He demonstrates. 2 + 2 = 4 appears on screen*

*The team erupts in applause*

**JENNY**  
It's beautiful!

**DEREK**  
It actually does something!

**RAJESH**  
I can demo this to stakeholders!

*The Jazz Robot appears one last time, playing a celebratory tune*

**JAZZ ROBOT**  
ðŸŽ·ðŸ¤– This feature actually exists! No confession needed!

*The robot fades away*

**SARAH** *(talking head)*  
We learned something important. The Definition of Done isn't "I wrote code." It's not "I documented it." It's not even "it compiles." The Definition of Done is "A user can use it to do something useful." Revolutionary, I know.

---

## EPILOGUE

**INT. OPEN OFFICE - ONE MONTH LATER**

*The office is calmer. The "Days Since Last Working Feature" counter now reads "0" (it resets daily as features actually ship)*

**MARCUS** *(talking head)*  
I'm in recovery now. Architecture Astronauts Anonymous. Hi, my name is Marcus, and I once spent three weeks building an abstract factory for factories that didn't exist.

*Cut to: Jenny at her desk, actually coding*

**JENNY** *(talking head)*  
We have five working plugins now. FIVE! That's more than we had in six months of Marcus's "comprehensive ecosystem." Turns out, making things work is actually easier than explaining why they don't.

*Cut to: Derek, looking less burned out*

**DEREK** *(talking head)*  
The Jazz Robot still visits me in my dreams sometimes. But now it plays happy songs. Songs about functions that return actual values. About APIs that connect to real services. About documentation that describes things that exist.

*Cut to: Sarah, no flask in sight*

**SARAH** *(talking head)*  
We do real sprint reviews now. With working software. Stakeholders can actually use our features. It's weird. It's like we're doing actual Scrum instead of Scrum theater.

*Cut to: Rajesh on a video call*

**RAJESH**  
Yes, we have a calculator plugin that adds numbers! Real numbers! To get real results!

**STAKEHOLDER VOICE**  
That's... that's it?

**RAJESH**  
Yes! And it ACTUALLY WORKS!

**STAKEHOLDER VOICE**  
...Promotion approved.

*Cut to: The full team in the conference room, looking at a simple Kanban board*

**LINDA**  
What's our velocity now?

**SARAH**  
One working feature per sprint.

**LINDA**  
And before?

**SARAH**  
Zero working features per infinity.

**LINDA**  
Progress.

*The camera pulls back to show the office. On the wall, a new poster: "Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation - No, Really, We Mean It This Time"*

**FADE OUT**

---

## END CREDITS SCENE

*The Jazz Robot appears one final time, in a teaching setting*

**JAZZ ROBOT**  
ðŸŽ·ðŸ¤– Kids, remember the Scrum principles:
- Working software is the primary measure of progress
- Simplicity is essential
- If you're writing confessions instead of code, you're doing it wrong
- Abstract factories need actual factories
- The Definition of Done means DONE, not "done pending implementation"

*Plays a final jazzy note*

**JAZZ ROBOT**  
And remember, transparency about failure isn't the same as success! 

*Winks at camera*

**FINAL TITLE CARD:**  
"Based on true events. 290,000 lines of code were harmed in the making of this story."

**EDUCATIONAL EPILOGUE TEXT:**

This episode demonstrated these Scrum failures:
- No Definition of Done
- No Sprint Reviews with working demos
- Documentation as deliverables
- Architecture without implementation
- Scope creep without MVP discipline

Remember: In Scrum, "Done" means a user can use it, not that you've written about it.

## PRODUCTION NOTES

**Visual Gags:**
- The Jazz Robot becomes increasingly elaborate as the episode progresses, starting as a simple animation and ending up in full costume changes
- The `/plugins/` folder shot shows three lonely files in a directory structure designed for hundreds
- Split screens showing elaborate UML diagrams next to empty implementation files
- The "Days Since Last Working Feature" counter that never changes until the epilogue

**Running Gags:**
- Every demo triggers the Jazz Robot confession
- Rajesh translating obvious failures into corporate speak
- Derek's increasing alcoholism/recovery arc
- Sarah's descent from Scrum Master to Scrum Therapist
- Marcus treating code architecture like fine art

**Educational Moments:**
- Each act break includes a "What Should Have Happened" segment
- Character talking heads explain Scrum principles through their failures
- The epilogue explicitly lists the violated principles
- The Jazz Robot becomes a teaching assistant in the end credits

**Character Arcs:**
- Marcus: From Architecture Astronaut to Reformed Developer
- Jenny: From Confused Junior to Voice of Reason
- Sarah: From Burned-Out to Re-Engaged Scrum Master
- Derek: From Cynical to Cautiously Optimistic
- Rajesh: From Enabler to Actual Product Manager

**Thematic Elements:**
- The danger of valuing form over function
- How transparency about failure isn't the same as success
- The importance of regular reality checks
- How small teams can create massive technical debt
- The redemptive power of radical simplification

*"This script is dedicated to every developer who has ever built an elaborate system for features that don't exist, and to every Scrum Master who has tried to explain why 'spiritually complete' isn't a valid sprint status."*

**[END OF SCRIPT]**

## WRITER'S NOTES

This script achieves several goals:

1. **Educational Value**: Every comedic moment teaches a Scrum principle through violation
2. **Relatable Humor**: Every developer will recognize these patterns
3. **Character Development**: Each character represents a real dysfunction and gets a redemption arc
4. **Visual Comedy**: The Jazz Robot becomes a beloved recurring character
5. **Genuine Heart**: The ending shows that recovery is possible through simplification

The episode works as both standalone comedy and educational content, using the absurdity of the real situation to highlight important agile principles. The FunkBot Protocol becomes a perfect metaphor for transparency theaterâ€”admitting problems without fixing them.

The script can be produced on a typical office comedy budget, with the Jazz Robot as the only special effect (which could be done simply with animation or even a person in a costume for live action).

Most importantly, it captures the very real phenomenon of architecture astronauts, enabler PMs, and burned-out team members while offering hope through the redemptive power of actually shipping working software.
