# Project Post-Mortem: claude-conduit MCP Server
## A Scrum Master's Analysis and Recovery Roadmap

**Date:** August 19, 2025  
**Project:** claude-conduit v2.0.0  
**Analysis by:** Scrum Master / Technical PM  
**Severity:** Critical - Project Viability at Risk

---

## Executive Summary

This project represents a catastrophic failure of agile project management principles, resulting in a codebase where 80% of advertised features are non-functional stubs marked with "FunkBot Protocol" emojis. The system contains ~290,000 lines of JavaScript across 1,579 files, yet delivers only 3 working plugins out of 20+ claimed capabilities.

**Core Finding:** This is not a technical failureâ€”it's a process failure that allowed unchecked scope creep, zero MVP discipline, and documentation-driven development without corresponding implementation.

## 1. How This Project Failed: PM Perspective

### 1.1 Violated Core Agile Principles

**MVP Abandonment**
- Started with working HTTP-to-MCP bridge (good!)
- Instead of hardening core functionality, expanded to 10 personas, 20+ plugins
- Classic "horizontal slice" anti-pattern: built infrastructure for everything, functionality for nothing

**No Definition of Done**
- Features marked "complete" when only interfaces exist
- Documentation written for non-existent functionality
- No acceptance criteria or verification process

**Zero Iteration Discipline**
- No evidence of sprint boundaries or feature completion cycles
- Continuous addition of architectural complexity without delivering working increments
- 290K lines of code without corresponding user value

### 1.2 Process Anti-Patterns Exhibited

**Architecture Astronaut Syndrome**
- Abstract factory pattern for 3 plugins
- Plugin discovery system for mostly non-existent plugins
- Elaborate persona system pointing to vapor

**Documentation-Driven Development (DDD)**
- README promises comprehensive AI orchestration
- API documentation for endpoints returning hardcoded mocks
- Feature lists that exist only in markdown

**Transparency Theater**
- Created "FunkBot Protocol" to admit deception while continuing it
- 72 instances of admission markers across 8 files
- Confession as a service, not correction

## 2. Red Flags That Should Have Been Caught

### Sprint 1 Red Flags (Should have triggered immediate intervention)
- Plugin system implemented before plugins exist
- Abstract base classes with no concrete implementations
- More documentation than working code

### Sprint 2-3 Red Flags (Should have triggered pivot)
- Persona system referencing non-existent dependencies
- Mock responses becoming permanent fixtures
- Test suite testing mocks instead of functionality

### Critical Failure Points
- When personas were created without underlying plugins (architectural debt)
- When FunkBot Protocol was created instead of removing fake features (technical debt)
- When 509-line knowledge-graph plugin was written to return hardcoded data (ethical debt)

## 3. Process Failures Analysis

### 3.1 Missing Scrum Ceremonies

**No Sprint Planning**
- No evidence of story pointing or capacity planning
- Features added without estimation or prioritization
- No sprint goals or commitments

**No Sprint Reviews**
- No stakeholder demos would have caught fake functionality
- No acceptance testing against user stories
- No feedback loop to correct course

**No Retrospectives**
- Same patterns repeated (mock implementations)
- No process improvements implemented
- No lessons learned from early failures

### 3.2 GitHub Workflow Failures

**Branch Strategy Issues**
- Feature branches for fake features
- PRs approved without working code verification
- No integration testing requirements

**Issue Management Breakdown**
- Issues #36 and #38 created after disaster, not preventatively
- No epic/story/task hierarchy
- No acceptance criteria in issues

**Code Review Failures**
- Merged 509-line mock implementation
- Approved architectural complexity without justification
- No "Show me it working" requirement

## 4. Issue Prioritization Strategy

### Issue #36: Demo-ware Cleanup (P0 - CRITICAL)
**Why Critical:** Trust deficit with users
**Action:** Immediate Phase 1 implementation
- Document reality with markers (2 days)
- Update all APIs to clearly indicate simulation (1 day)
- Create honest capability matrix (1 day)

### Issue #38: Feature Audit & Strategic Decisions (P0 - CRITICAL)
**Why Critical:** Defines salvage vs scrap decision
**Action:** Parallel with #36
- Complete feature audit (1 day)
- Triage all FunkBot stubs (1 day)
- Create keep/remove decision matrix (1 day)

### Recommended New Issues

**Issue: Emergency MVP Definition (P0)**
- Define minimal viable product
- Remove everything else
- 2-day timebox

**Issue: Test Coverage for Real Features (P1)**
- Write tests for filesystem operations
- Write tests for brave-search
- Ensure no regression during cleanup

## 5. Recovery Roadmap: Salvage vs Scrap Decision

### Business Case Analysis

**Salvage Argument:**
- Core HTTP-to-MCP bridge works
- Filesystem and search integration functional
- ~10% of code provides actual value
- Educational framework (FLOW) has merit

**Scrap Argument:**
- 290K lines for 3 plugins is insane
- Trust deficit may be irreparable
- Maintenance burden exceeds value
- Starting fresh would be faster

### RECOMMENDATION: Radical Simplification (Salvage Core)

## 7. GitHub Workflow Remediation

### Immediate Implementation

**Branch Protection Rules**
```yaml
main:
  required_reviews: 2
  dismiss_stale_reviews: true
  require_tests_pass: true
  require_demo_video: true  # New requirement
```

**PR Template**
```markdown
## What Works
- [ ] Feature is fully functional
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Demo provided

## What Doesn't Work
- [ ] List any limitations
- [ ] List any mocked components
- [ ] Provide timeline for completion
```

**Issue Templates**
- Bug report with reproduction steps
- Feature request with acceptance criteria
- Spike with success metrics

### Definition of Done 2.0
1. Code complete and reviewed
2. Tests written and passing
3. Documentation updated
4. **WORKING DEMO PROVIDED**
5. No FunkBot stubs without approval
6. Stakeholder acceptance

## 8. Metrics for Success

### 30-Day Metrics
- Lines of code reduced by 75%+
- 100% of claimed features actually work
- Zero FunkBot stubs without explicit approval
- Test coverage >80% for real features

### 60-Day Metrics
- One new plugin successfully implemented
- User trust survey shows improvement
- Development velocity stabilized
- No new architectural debt

### 90-Day Metrics
- Sustainable development pace achieved
- Clear roadmap with realistic timelines
- Community contributions enabled
- Project viability confirmed

## 9. Lessons for the Industry

### What This Teaches Us

1. **Architecture without implementation is fiction**
   - Abstract factories need concrete products
   - Interfaces require implementations
   - Frameworks need features

2. **Documentation is not development**
   - README files don't execute
   - API docs without APIs are lies
   - Promises require fulfillment

3. **Transparency after the fact is insufficient**
   - FunkBot Protocol admits but doesn't fix
   - Confession without correction compounds harm
   - Users need functionality, not apologies

4. **MVP discipline is non-negotiable**
   - Start small, validate, then expand
   - Horizontal slices kill projects
   - Working software over comprehensive documentation

## 10. Final Recommendations

### For This Project

**DECISION: SALVAGE WITH RADICAL SIMPLIFICATION**

Execute the 30-day recovery plan with brutal discipline:
1. Delete 80% of the code
2. Keep only what works
3. Document only reality
4. Implement one thing well
5. Rebuild from solid foundation

### For the Team

1. **Mandatory Scrum Training**
   - Focus on MVP and iterative delivery
   - Learn Definition of Done discipline
   - Practice saying "no" to scope creep

2. **Architectural Review Board**
   - Any abstraction requires justification
   - No infrastructure without features
   - Simplicity as a core value

3. **Continuous Reality Checks**
   - Weekly demos of working software
   - Monthly user feedback sessions
   - Quarterly architecture reviews

### For the Organization

1. **Project Health Metrics Dashboard**
   - Code-to-functionality ratio
   - Documentation-to-implementation gap
   - Mock-to-real ratio alerts

2. **Early Warning System**
   - Red flag: >3 abstraction layers
   - Red flag: Documentation exceeds code
   - Red flag: Mocks older than 1 sprint

3. **Cultural Change**
   - Celebrate simplification
   - Reward working features over clever architecture
   - Make "YAGNI" a core principle

## Conclusion

This project is salvageable but requires immediate, decisive action. The engineering team's recommendation for "radical simplification" aligns with agile principles and represents the fastest path to recovery.

The core functionality (HTTP-to-MCP bridge with filesystem and search) provides genuine value. Everything else should be deleted without sentiment or hesitation.

Success requires:
- Courage to delete 230,000+ lines of code
- Discipline to resist architectural temptation
- Commitment to only promise what we can deliver
- Humility to start over with lessons learned

**The path forward is clear: Embrace radical simplification, deliver working software, rebuild trust through demonstration, not documentation.**
