# Continuous Review Process: Competence Over Complexity
## Preventing Another FunkBot Disaster Through Systematic Review

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Effective Date:** Immediate  
**Owner:** Engineering & Scrum Master  
**Enforcement:** Mandatory for all contributions

---

## Executive Summary

This process ensures that competence (simple, working solutions) is prioritized over complexity (elaborate, non-functional architectures). It makes it impossible for another FunkBot situationâ€”290,000 lines of fake featuresâ€”to develop by requiring continuous demonstration of working functionality.

**Core Principle:** *"Show me it working, or it doesn't merge."*

---

## 1. PR Requirements: The Working Demo Mandate

### 1.1 Every PR Must Include

```yaml
Required Artifacts:
  - working_demo: Video or GIF showing feature in action
  - test_results: Automated test execution output
  - manual_verification: Step-by-step reproduction guide
  - complexity_score: Self-assessment against rubric
```

### 1.2 Working Demo Standards

**Acceptable Demo Formats:**
- Loom/video recording (< 3 minutes)
- Terminal recording via asciinema
- GIF for simple UI changes
- Live demo in sprint review (recorded)

**Demo Must Show:**
1. Feature working end-to-end
2. Error handling scenarios
3. Integration with existing features
4. Performance under normal load

**Red Flags in Demos:**
- Hardcoded data shown as "examples"
- "This will work when X is implemented"
- Skipping over error cases
- No user-facing functionality shown

### 1.3 The "No Demo, No Merge" Rule

```javascript
// GitHub Action: demo-required.yml
name: Demo Verification
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, edited]

jobs:
  check-demo:
    steps:
      - name: Verify Demo Exists
        run: |
          if ! grep -q "Demo:" ${{ github.event.pull_request.body }}; then
            echo "::error::PR must include demo link"
            exit 1
          fi
```

---

## 2. Competence Metrics: Measuring Simplicity

### 2.1 Complexity Score Rubric

Each PR must self-score on complexity (lower is better):

| Aspect | Simple (1) | Moderate (2) | Complex (3) | Over-engineered (4) |
|--------|------------|--------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Abstraction Layers** | Direct implementation | 1 abstraction | 2-3 abstractions | 4+ abstractions |
| **Lines of Code** | < 100 | 100-300 | 300-500 | > 500 |
| **Dependencies** | Uses existing | 1-2 new deps | 3-4 new deps | 5+ new deps |
| **Interfaces** | Concrete only | 1 interface | 2-3 interfaces | 4+ interfaces |
| **Test Complexity** | Simple assertions | Some mocking | Heavy mocking | Mock-ception |
| **Documentation** | Code self-documents | Minimal docs | Extensive docs | Docs > code |

**Scoring:**
- **6-8:** Green light (competent solution)
- **9-12:** Yellow light (review for simplification)
- **13-16:** Orange light (requires justification)
- **17+:** Red light (must simplify before merge)

### 2.2 The KISS Coefficient

```
KISS Coefficient = Working Features / Total Lines of Code

Target: > 0.001 (1 feature per 1000 lines)
Warning: < 0.0001 (1 feature per 10,000 lines)
Critical: < 0.00001 (FunkBot territory)
```

### 2.3 Automated Complexity Alerts

```yaml
# .github/workflows/complexity-check.yml
- name: Check Complexity
  run: |
    npx complexity-report --max-complexity 10
    npx plato -r -d complexity-report src/
    
    # Alert if abstraction depth > 3
    if grep -r "extends.*extends.*extends" src/; then
      echo "::warning::Deep inheritance detected"
    fi
```

## 3. Complexity Audits: Regular Health Checks

### 3.1 Weekly Complexity Review

**Every Monday Morning:**
```markdown
## Weekly Complexity Audit Checklist

- [ ] Review all "TODO" and "FIXME" comments
- [ ] Count mock implementations vs real
- [ ] Check abstraction depth in new code
- [ ] Verify all endpoints return real data
- [ ] Review documentation-to-code ratio
- [ ] Identify any "future-proofing" code
```

### 3.2 Monthly Architecture Review

**First Friday of Each Month:**

```markdown
## Architecture Health Assessment

1. **Feature Audit**
   - List all claimed features
   - Test each feature manually
   - Mark as: Working | Partial | Fake
   
2. **Complexity Creep Check**
   - Compare lines of code month-over-month
   - Compare working features month-over-month
   - Calculate complexity trend
   
3. **Mock Inventory**
   - List all mock responses
   - Age of each mock (days)
   - Plan for implementation or removal
   
4. **Abstraction Analysis**
   - Count interfaces without implementations
   - Count abstract classes without concrete uses
   - Count factory patterns vs actual products
```

### 3.3 Quarterly "Simplification Sprint"

**Every 3 months: Dedicated complexity reduction**

```markdown
## Simplification Sprint Goals

Week 1: Audit & Identify
- Find most complex components
- Identify unused abstractions
- List over-engineered features

Week 2: Simplify
- Reduce abstraction layers
- Combine similar interfaces
- Remove unused code
- Convert complex to simple

Success Metrics:
- 20% reduction in lines of code
- 0% reduction in functionality
- Improved test coverage
- Faster build times
```

---

## 4. Escalation Process: When Complexity Creeps

### 4.1 Three-Strike System

**Strike 1: Yellow Card**
- PR adds unnecessary abstraction
- Action: Educational review, suggest simplification
- Record: Note in developer's review history

**Strike 2: Orange Card**
- Second complexity violation within sprint
- Action: Pair programming on simplification
- Record: Discussion in retrospective

**Strike 3: Red Card**
- Pattern of over-engineering established
- Action: All PRs require senior review
- Record: Improvement plan created

### 4.2 The Complexity Intervention

When a component exceeds complexity thresholds:

```markdown
## Complexity Intervention Protocol

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Freeze feature additions to component
   - Assign simplification owner
   - Create technical debt ticket
   
2. **Intervention Meeting** (within 24 hours)
   Participants: Developer, Tech Lead, Scrum Master
   
   Agenda:
   - Review complexity metrics
   - Identify root cause
   - Plan simplification approach
   - Set deadline for resolution
   
3. **Follow-up**
   - Daily check-ins until resolved
   - Share lessons learned with team
   - Update coding guidelines
```

### 4.3 The Nuclear Option: Feature Freeze

When complexity debt exceeds threshold:

```yaml
Triggers for Feature Freeze:
  - KISS Coefficient < 0.00001
  - Mock implementations > 50% of features
  - Abstraction depth > 5 layers
  - Documentation exceeds code by 2x

During Freeze:
  - No new features
  - Only simplification and bug fixes
  - Daily complexity reduction standups
  - Continue until metrics improve
```

## 5. Sprint Retrospective: The Complexity Question

### 5.1 Mandatory Retrospective Questions

**Every Sprint Retrospective MUST Ask:**

1. **"Did we make anything more complex than needed?"**
   - Review each completed story
   - Identify over-engineering
   - Plan simplification

2. **"What would a junior developer build?"**
   - Compare our solution to simplest approach
   - Justify additional complexity
   - Consider refactoring

3. **"Can we explain this to a non-developer?"**
   - Test our abstractions against reality
   - Identify conceptual overhead
   - Simplify mental model

4. **"What would we delete if we could?"**
   - List dispensable code
   - Plan removal in next sprint
   - Celebrate deletions

### 5.2 Complexity Metrics Review

```markdown
## Sprint Complexity Report

## Conclusion: A Culture of Competence

This process makes it impossible for complexity to win over competence by:

1. **Requiring proof of work** - No code merges without working demos
2. **Measuring complexity continuously** - Automated scoring and alerts
3. **Reviewing regularly** - Weekly audits, monthly reviews, quarterly sprints
4. **Escalating quickly** - Clear triggers and intervention protocols
5. **Celebrating simplicity** - Recognition and rewards for competent solutions

**Remember:** Every line of code is a liability. Every abstraction is a loan against future understanding. Every mock is a broken promise. Choose competence. Choose simplicity. Choose working software.
