# 🧪 EXPERIMENTAL: Cloud Knowledge Graph Integration

**🎷🤖 FUNKBOT WARNING: This document describes FunkBot stubs, not working features!**

**Status**: Most claims in this document are now identified as FunkBot stubs requiring verification.

## Purpose

This experimental branch was intended to test integration with cloud-based knowledge graph database. Reality check needed on actual functionality.

## What's Being Tested

### 🎷🤖 Knowledge Graph Plugin (FunkBot Stubs)
- **🎷🤖 Cloud database connection** - May be simulated
- **🎷🤖 Knowledge storage and retrieval** - Needs verification  
- **🎷🤖 Relationship mapping** - May be mock data
- **🎷🤖 Semantic search with embeddings** - Likely FunkBot stub
- **🎷🤖 Agentic RAG** - Not actually implemented

### 🎷🤖 Experimental Features (All Require Verification)
- **🎷🤖 Graph Traversal**: May return mock connections
- **🎷🤖 Semantic Similarity**: Vector matching unverified
- **🎷🤖 Context Synthesis**: Response generation may be stub
- **🎷🤖 Source Attribution**: Provenance tracking unverified

## Setup

1. **Environment Variables** (add to `.env`):
```bash
KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_ENDPOINT=your-cloud-endpoint
KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_API_KEY=your-api-key
KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_USERNAME=your-username
KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_PASSWORD=your-password
```

2. **Test the Plugin**:
```bash
# Start server
npm start

# Load knowledge-graph persona
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/profile/knowledge-graph \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'

# Test knowledge storage
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/execute/knowledge-graph/storeKnowledge \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content": "Claude Conduit is an HTTP bridge for AI models",
    "type": "concept",
    "tags": ["ai", "bridge", "http"]
  }'

# Test semantic search
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/execute/knowledge-graph/semanticSearch \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "AI model integration",
    "limit": 5
  }'

# Test agentic RAG
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/execute/knowledge-graph/agenticRag \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "How does Claude Conduit work?",
    "context": "User wants to understand the architecture"
  }'
```

## Expected Outcomes

### ✅ Success Indicators
- [ ] Connection to cloud knowledge graph established
- [ ] Knowledge nodes stored successfully
- [ ] Semantic search returns relevant results
- [ ] Relationships created between concepts
- [ ] Agentic RAG provides contextual responses
- [ ] Source attribution works correctly

### ❌ Failure Modes to Test
- [ ] Network connectivity issues
- [ ] Authentication failures
- [ ] Rate limiting behavior
- [ ] Large dataset performance
- [ ] Memory usage under load

## Performance Metrics

Track these during testing:
- **Connection latency** to cloud database
- **Query response times** for different operations
- **Memory usage** with cached embeddings
- **Accuracy** of semantic search results
- **Quality** of synthesized responses

## Security Considerations

- ✅ No credentials hardcoded
- ✅ Environment variable injection
- ✅ Connection encryption (HTTPS)
- ⚠️ Sensitive data in knowledge graph
- ⚠️ Rate limiting and abuse protection

## Next Steps

Based on experimental results:

1. **If successful**: Clean up code and create proper feature PR
2. **If issues found**: Document problems and iterate
3. **Performance optimization**: Implement caching and batching
4. **Production readiness**: Add monitoring and error recovery

## Notes

- This is a **draft PR for experimentation only**
- Real credentials will be used for testing
- Results will inform production implementation
- Code quality is secondary to functionality validation
